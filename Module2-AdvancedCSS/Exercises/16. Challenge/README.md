# Module 2 Challenge: Advanced CSS
This challenge will be **New Project/Starting from Scratch** format, which means you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you will have to create an application from scratch. In this challenge you will be tasked with creating your very own portfolio to showcase your skills and the work you have done.
<br/>

Having a portfolio is very important on the job search. It allows you to showcase your skills and talents to employers who are looking to hire. A good portfolio will highlight your strongest skills and explain your thought process behind.

With this in mind, this challenge will help set you up for a more successful future by applying the skills you've aquired. You will be able to practice and hone your abilities all while creating something that will assist you on your job hunt.

> **NOTE**: You likely won't have enough applications under your belt at this point to fill your portfolio, for now use placeholders and they can always be updated later on.

Lets consider what a user story from the perspective of a company trying to hire may look like. Remember we follow an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.

### **User Story**

>AS A employer <br/>
>I WANT to view a potential employee's portfolio to view their skills <br/>
>SO THAT I can have a better understanding of their abilities and assess whether they are a good candidate for our company


### **Acceptance Criteria**

This is a list of requirements to develop a portfoliop that satisfies the employer's needs:

>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work <br/>
>WHEN I load their portfolio <br/>
>THEN I am presented wih the developer's name, avatar, a section about them, their work, and how to get in contact with them<br/>
>WHEN I click on a link within the nav bar  <br/>
>THEN the UI scrolls down to the corresponding section of the page<br/>
>WHEN I click on the link assoctiated with their work <br/>
>THEN the UI scrolls to the section showcasing the developers previous work<br/>
