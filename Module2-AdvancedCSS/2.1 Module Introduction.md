# Module Introduction
## Module 02: Advanced CSS
More and more people are starting to browse the internet using a mobile device. This is causing developers to change the approach they take when designing the layout of a page. With Advanced CSS such as media queries adn flexbox we are able to accomodate multiple screen sizes and build apps with a mobile-first mindset. Also in todays world website design has evolved so much and we take a lot of ordinary things for granted, such as animated hover effects, rounded corners, and shadows. Back in the day, it required some complex workaround or even some JavaScript "magic" to implement these, but with modern CSS properties they are very simple to do. We will put our focus on responsive web design and advanced CSS for this module.
