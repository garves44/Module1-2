# Module Introduction
## Module 01: HTML, CSS, and Git
**HTML**, otherwise known as **Hypertext Markup Language**, is the baseline of every website. As the standard language used to build the basic structure of a website, HTML allows developers to create a wide range of elements such as, Paragraphs, Images, Links, Forms, and much more.

**CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets** is used to add custom styling to the HTML elements. CSS is the key factor to determine how elements are presented on the webpage, anything from font size, color, position, or animations.

The primary focus in this module is to teach you how to build websites using HTML and CSS. You will also be introduced to Git, a version control system, as well as how to separate different versions of your code. This is the most basic building block of web development and they are essential skills that you will use throughout your career.

### **Challenge**
For this module's challenge you will use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing site is accessible, according to the provided acceptance criteria. Accessibiltiy is an increasingly important aspect to consider in web design. An inclusive design ensures that all users - even those who are disabled - can interact with your website and its content.
