# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor
This challenge will be **Feature Requests/Updte Existing** format, which means you will be given starter code that you need to modify. A very important aspect of web development covered in this challenge is **accessibility**. 
<br/>

One of the most common tasks for a new developer otherwise known as a junior developer is to take code that already exists and **refactor** it.

* **Refactor** means to improve the way code is written, without changing what it does

In this challenge you will refactor an existing website to make it more accessible.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important thing to consider for many business. It allows people with disabilities to use the website using assistive technologies such as screen readers, video captions, and even braille keybords. Making a website accessible has many benefits, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It could also help a company avoid any litigation that could occur when people with disablities can't use thir website. <br />
Even though accessibilit is a very broad topic with many complex requirements, we icluded a small list of specific criteria you need to satisfy this challenge. Refer to the Acceptance Criteria section for a list of this criteria.

> A good rule to follow when working on someone elses code is called the **Scout Rule**, which means you always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it.

A good way to impress clients is to always go the extra mile and improve the code base for the long-term and make it more stable. **EXAMPLE**: Make sure that all links are functioning correctly and there are no dead links on the page leading to 404. Also refactor the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties. Organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and even adding comments before each section of the page. <p>&nbsp;</p>

Here are Module 1 challenge requirements:

### **User Story**

>AS A marketing agency <br/>
>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br/>
>SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines


### **Acceptance Criteria**

>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br/>
>WHEN I view the source code <br/>
>THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br/>
>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br/>
>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br/>
>WHEN I view the image elements <br/>
>THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br/>
>WHEN I view the header elements <br/>
>THEN they fall in sequential order<br/>
>WHEN I view the title element <br/>
>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br/>

### **Mock-Up**

>**NOTE**: This screenshot may be slightly different than you see on your screen based on screen size/resolution. In the future you will learn how to make your site **responsive** so your application is optimized for every screen size.
