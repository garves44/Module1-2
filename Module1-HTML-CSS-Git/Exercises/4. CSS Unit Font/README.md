# CSS Styling Not Applied to HTML Elements

Edit the starter code to match the user story below.

* Users should be able to see styling applied to HTML elements when the page is opened.

## Expected Behavior

* Each section should have a background color of `#fffacd`, and the font family `"Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif` should be specified.

* The `fact-1` paragraph should be bold.

* The `fact-2` paragraph should have a font size of 24px.

* The `fact-3` paragraph should have a line height of 50px.

* The finished page should match the mockup.

## Actual Behavior

When a user opens the page, no styling is visible. 

## Assets
