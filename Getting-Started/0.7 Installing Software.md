# Installing Software
In order to complete this course, you will be asked to install programs and sign up for services as they are needed to do the content. In order to get going on the first module, you will need to set up a few things on your computer. Below is a list of programs you will need to start Module 1.

## Ready to Start
I have provided links/instructions on where to find the programs, however, if the links are not working you can always google it. You need to install/download the following tools before you can begin:


* Google Chrome - https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/
* Visual Studio (VS) Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* Open In Browser (VS Code Extension) - On left side of VS code click "Extensions" button and search for it. 
* Live Server (VS Code Extension) - On left side of VS code click "Extensions" button and search for it. 
* Git Bash (Windows only) - https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Terminal (macOS only; PREINSTALLED)
* Github.com - Go here and create an account if you don't already have one.
* Xcode (macOS only)
* Homebrew (macOS only)
* SSH Key - You will need to generate an ssh key and link your computer to your github account.(more on this later)

Great work! You are now setup with the tools needed to proceed to Module 1.
